#
# ISTIO AUTHORIZATION POLICY
# Purpose: Fine-grained access control for service-to-service communication
# Renders: When both .Values.enabled and .Values.authorizationPolicy.enabled are true
#
# What it does:
# - Controls WHO can access this service (based on service identity/principal)
# - Controls WHAT operations are allowed (HTTP methods, paths, headers)
# - Provides deny-by-default security (if no rules match, request is denied)
# - Can ALLOW, DENY, or AUDIT requests for security monitoring
#
# Key concepts:
# - action: ALLOW (permit matching requests), DENY (block), AUDIT (log only)
# - rules: List of conditions (from, to, when) that must match
# - from.source.principals: Service account identities (cluster.local/ns/<namespace>/sa/<name>)
# - to.operation.methods/paths: HTTP operations allowed
# - Default: No policy = all traffic allowed, empty policy = all traffic denied
